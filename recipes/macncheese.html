    <h3>This is Smitten Kitchen's recipe for mac and cheese! Very quick and simple to put together!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>4 ounches dried pasta</li>
        <li>2 tsp salted or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2c low-fat or whole milk</li>
        <li>Lots of freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2c finely grated parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a small-to-medium pot of very well-salted water to a boil and add your dried pasta. Cook it until firm tender, then drain.</li>
        <li>Return pot to stove and melt butter in the bottom. Using a spoon or whisk, add flour and mix until it disappears. Add milk, a tiny splash at a time, stirring constantly so no lumps form.</li>
        <li>Season with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and many grinds of black pepper. Bring sauce to a simmer. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese until combined. Add drained pasta, stir to evenly coat. Scoop into a bowl and finish it with more black pepper, if you wish. Repeat as needed.</li>
    </ol>
